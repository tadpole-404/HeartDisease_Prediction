# Heart Disease Prediction

The heart rate prediction is a final project for my CS106 Basics of Machine Learning course. It is a logistic regression-based model which aimed to predict if a person has heart disease based on some parameters such as age group, whether a person is a smoker, etc.

There are various performance metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, etc., to test the performance of the model.

The dataset that the model was trained on can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease).
