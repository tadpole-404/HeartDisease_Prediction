<h1> Heart Disease prediction</h1>


<p>
The heart rate prediction is a final project for my CS106  Basics of Machine Learning course. It is a logistic regression based model which aimed to predict if a person has heart disease based on some parameters such as Age group, if a person is Smoker etc.</p>

<p>
There are various performance metrices such as confusion matrix,accuracy etc. to test the performance of the model.
